 * whether it is there. Off unless turned on in Innstillinger: then nothing
 * is ever sent to Seerr and the app is as it was.
 *
 * Kept in /download0/jelly5/seerr.json: per Jellyfin server whether Seerr
 * is on and its address; per account how it signs in and its session
 * cookie (as accounts.json keeps the Jellyfin tokens); for the console,
 * whether it has Internet.
 *
 * Signing in needs nothing by default: Seerr starts a Quick Connect, the
 * Jellyfin account in use approves it, and Seerr opens that user's session
 * (Seerr 3.4 and later). The Jellyfin password or a local Seerr account
 * are the fallbacks. Everything runs on worker threads; the render thread
 * only reads snapshot().
